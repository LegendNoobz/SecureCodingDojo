The Caesar cipher is an ancient method for hiding a message known to be used by Julius Caesar.

#### Algorithm
Shift letters by a number of positions. The number of positions is the key. 

##### Example
ABCD becomes BCDE shifted right by one.
ABCD becomes ZACD shifted left by one.

##### Weakness
It can be easily deciphered by trying all possible shifts and there are as many shifts as letters in the alphabet.
